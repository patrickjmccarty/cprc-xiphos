This project contains the user library, sample applications, bootloader, datasheets, and other documentation for the Xiphos Board created by Darron Baida primarily for the Cal Poly Robotics Club. Though targeted towards Xiphos users, some of the code may be useful for other AVR microcontrollers.

All microcontroller code is written in C, using the avr-libc library, though a sample C# GUI control program will be added within a month or so.

A few parts of the library are derived from code written by Dr. John Seng for the PolyBot Board. The bootloader is a customized version of the "AVRPROG compatible bootloader for ATMEL ATmega Controllers" written by Martin Thomas, version 0.85 (Dec 3, 2008).
